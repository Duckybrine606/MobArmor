# MobArmor
This in an old project of mine, made for minecraft 1.16.4/5. In this plugin, almost all mobs are op (they have armor and weapons)

This project CANNOT be updated because I lost the files when a BIG error happened to my pc and I lost a big amount of files

I might Re-code it all from scratch if I decide to someday though

Click on MobArmorFinal.jar and click "view raw" to automatically download it (or just click download i just realised that exists lol)



UPDATE: I found some screenshots of the listeners class (which is like 75% of the code) that i had. i'll copy the code and then create the main class again.
i may even update it later when im back from vacation.
